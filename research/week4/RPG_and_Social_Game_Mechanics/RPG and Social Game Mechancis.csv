Can be used to create artificial challenges by limiting their class choices.","Classes that are too strict or limited can make players feel as though they were missing out on some part of the game, especially if there's no way to change classes","For games that use the Tank-DPS-Healer trinity, classes will define which players will play with which other players.

Status,"Social, RPG, MMO",Ability to compare relative achievement against a systematic opponent,"High scores, timed challenges, percent completion, leaderboards, ladders","Emphasizing this can put off players less-concerned with things that score points, like Explorers. To counter this, ""points"" should be awarded for all types of gameplay","Quanitfies value of various challenges, creates a standard for parallel symmetric competition","Scores and number values can detract from the game itself, and can also lower the game's immersion factor","In multiplayer games, many players participate largely to earn in-game status, achievements, and perhaps make a name for themselves in the community.

For intsance, in many MMOs, players need to reach the level cap in order to really enjoy endgame material, like large raids, battlegrounds, and PvP brackets","Having access to a ""roped-off"" area or item is a measure of prestige among players.
